Ruby-Kata
=========

Series of different TDD katas with the aim of learning the ruby language.


I just want to gather here all the shocking stuff I met in Ruby coming from c/c++, C# and Java.


* The first thing is the whole new meaning of what object-oriented means.
   When I first learned to program, C++ seemed like object-oriented, and Java looked like object-forced.

  When I graduated I thought C++ lets you do object, but not that oriented, and Java + C# is the way to gOO.

  Now I think Java and C# is oriented about objects while Ruby is Based On objects. Woah.
